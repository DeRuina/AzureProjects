# Azure Projects 

Welcome to my repository of Azure projects! This repository contains a collection of projects I've worked on using Microsoft Azure. Each project is designed to demonstrate various Azure services and features, providing a practical learning experience for anyone interested in cloud computing and Azure.

## Projects

- [Creating a Virtual Machine and Deploying a Web Server](./Creating%20a%20Virtual%20Machine%20and%20Deploying%20a%20Web%20Server%20/README.md) - This project is a step-by-step video guide on creating a Virtual Machine in Azure to deploy a web server, specifically a Nextcloud server. It explores the basic architecture of Azure by creating a Virtual Machine, connecting it to a subnet, protected by inbound and outbound rules thanks to Network Security Groups, in a Virtual Network. The guide also covers using Bastion to connect to the machine via SSH, without exposing an external port to the Internet, and then installing a simple Nextcloud server and making the Virtual Machine available by opening a public IP and a DNS label.

## Getting Started
